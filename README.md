# Teach Away Mega Menu QA Automation 

This repository contains the Teach Away Mega Menu Test Scripts,  organized across multiple pages, demonstrating a comprehensive testing strategy for each component of the Mega Menu. The primary objective is to ensure extensive test coverage for the website's mega menu, while striving for optimal functionality and exemplary results.

## The Structure

- Pages

    This project is thoughtfully structured into individual pages folders for each item on the menu, such as Jobs, TEFL, Teacher Certification, Courses, Hire Teachers, Login/Register. Within each of these folders, you'll find multiple pages that correspond to main subcategories and elements on the menus. This approach allows for a seamless navigation experience and facilitates comprehensive testing of all  functionalities within the Mega Menu.

- Test Cases
    The test cases have been implemented in a systematic numeric order. Each test case incorporates methods from the respective pages, generating multiple tests based on the functionalities and items associated with specific menus or submenus. This approach ensures that the test cases align with the sequence of pages, maintaining consistency and logical progression throughout the testing process.
    

- Documentation

   I have provided additional detailed materials such as a Test Strategy Document and a Requirements Traceability Matrix. The Test Strategy Document includes various aspects such as approaches, implementation strategies, scope, testing tools, and methods employed. This document serves as a guide outlining the overall testing strategy.

  Additionally, the Requirements Traceability Matrix provides a systematic and traceable record of the testing process. It showcases the correlation between the test cases and the specific requirements, allowing for easy tracking and verification of the test results.
